            <p>Since I was little, I always felt that there were only a group of people who had the authority to put up
                something to the web. In fact, I thought they were only in the United States
                Facebook was on trend, Google had made its name; browsers like the Mozilla firefox, Internet explorer
                and
                Opera mini were making waves all over the world. I didn't even think that web
                development was a thing for individuals. It was something very far from my imagination.</p>

            <p>
                I was introduced to programming the same year I returned from my full time mission, by Ojo Rufus
                Olajide,
                who was just starting off himself. programming quickly became my favorite thing
                from then on. I built my first website after reading a smaall text book on web design. It coveres topics
                on
                HTML and CSS. And seeing all the texts and beautiful colors I had put up on the web,
                I was so intrigued that I showed it to anyone who was ready to see something on my cell phone. I
                literally
                wrote my first lines of HTML and CSS on my android device.

                At this time, I thought that was all about it until I encountered the mother of the web, Javascript.
                This
                programming language put me on my toes and made my web development journey difficult.
                Jacascript is the language of the web and is so powerful that it can manipulate the webpage and also
                help
                with calculations. I started learning Javascript at <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn"
                    target="_blank" class="fcc-link">freecodecamp.org</a>, and when it started
                getting difficult, I paused for a while and then went back to the beginning of the freecodecamp's
                curriculum. I later realized that, if I was going to be a successful programmer, I would need to have
                mentors. So, I started talking to a few
                people to know how their journey was for them. I had a lot of support from these people and boom! I
                started
                to understand better. Things began to make sens
            </p>

            <p>
            <h2>
                The immersion
            </h2>
            Fast forward a year later, I decided I needed to immerse myself into the whole programming stuff. I decided
            to
            have a degree in any of the tech related courses. So I started studying the Applied technology with <a
                href="https://www.byupathway.org/bachelors-degree/applied-technology" class="byu-link"> BYU Idaho</a>,
            online.
            When I startde, I began to see the importance of building personal projects, working in teams, and, the best
            of
            them, googling things up. Byu Idaho made my web development journey easier. The professors were always
            trying to
            make sure that no one was left out. It was with this school,
            I learned how to use Python, php and Java. The experience was min blowing.
            </p>

            <p>
                While it might seem as though my journey was smooth, it wasn't. There were times I gave up the path to
                becoming a web developer. I remember hating myself because it felt like I wasn't making any headway
                towards
                achieving my goals. Most of the times, I compared myself to other programmers
                who I thought were doing great stuff. Their use of design, typography and all the complex stuff they did
                made me feel inadequate. But I when I realized that no one rogrammer knows it all, I bounced back.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my journey as a web developer, I learned a lot of things that has helped shape my life and coding
                abilities. It wasn't a smooth road and it still isn't. Just when you begin to feel like you've reached a
                roadblock, that's when you are actually about breaking a barrier that would help propel
                you in the world of programming. Programming was never easy, but is doable.
